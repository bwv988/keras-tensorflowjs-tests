        "## Introduction\n",
        "With the release of TensorFlow.js earlier in 2018 (https://js.tensorflow.org/), it is now possible to train and run Machine Learning models directly in a web browser and NodeJS-based applications. TensorFlow.js implements much of TensorFlow's proven API and thus opens up interesting possibilities to augment web applications with Machine Learning capabilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "This short notebook demonstrates a very simple workflow:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Train a model using Keras and Python.\n",
        "* Save the trained model.\n",
        "* Load the finished model into TensorFlow.js / Javascript and make predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "As always, a picture says more than a thousand words, so below is a very detailed and highly technical diagram of this workflow:\n",

        "![Workflow](https://github.com/bwv988/keras-tensorflowjs-tests/blob/master/assets/workflow.PNG?raw=1)\n",
        "\n",
        "To demonstrate the last part, we'll use a special cell in Google Colab to load and process Javascript.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Demo: Train offline, predict online\n",
        "Many real-world ML problems require complex neural network architectures, the training of which, while now feasible, wouldn't be very practical to do in a browser. This is especially valid for mobile applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "A far more common use case, however, would be to fetch a pre-trained model which was build e.g. on a GPU cluster in order to then make predictions. \n",
        "\n",
        "In the case of a neural networks, training the model entails establishing the weights, which is typically orders of magnitudes more expensive in terms of CPU compared to just applying the trained weights to make predictions, based on new data.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Part 1: Offline Model Training\n",
        "\n",
        "For this demonstration, I'll use the classical **Iris flower** dataset. The goal here is to predict the type (class) of flower based on four different measurements in cm taken from 150 flowers. The dataset is build into the `sklearn` package.\n",
