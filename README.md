# Keras and TensorFlow.js

[![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/bwv988/keras-tensorflowjs-tests/blob/master/colab-notebook/keras_tfjs.ipynb)

This repo contains a short tutorial on how to implement Machine Learning model sharing between between Keras / Python and TensorFlow.js / Javascript.

For this purpose, there are two simple notebooks:

* One compatible with vanilla Jupyter in the `jupyter-notebook/` directory.
* Another one which can be run on Google Colaboratory in the `colab-notebook/` directory.
