    "## Introduction\n",
    "With the release of TensorFlow.js earlier in 2018 (https://js.tensorflow.org/), it is now possible to train and run Machine Learning models directly in a web browser and NodeJS-based applications. TensorFlow.js implements much of TensorFlow's proven API and thus opens up interesting possibilities for enriching web applications with Machine Learning capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Demo: Train offline, predict online\n",
    "For many real-world ML problems which require very deep, recurrent, or convoluted neural networks, training of such models, while feasible, wouldn't be very practical to do in a browser. This is especially true for mobile applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "A far more common use case, however, would be to use a pre-trained model to predictions. In the example of a neural network, training the model entails establishing the weights, which is typically orders of magnitudes more expensive in terms of CPU compared to just applying the trained weights to make predictions, based on new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 1: Offline training\n",
    "\n",
    "For this toy example, we'll use the classical Iris flower dataset. The goal here is to predict the type of flower based on four different measurements in cm taken from 150 flowers. The dataset is build into the `sklearn` package.\n",
